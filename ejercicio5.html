            Kept his dick wet<br>

            Me and my head high<br>
            <em>And my tears dry</em><br>
            Get on without my guy<br>
            You went back to what you knew<br>
            So far removed from all that we went through<br>
            And I tread a troubled track<br>
            My odds are stacked<br>
            I'll go back to black<br></p></center>
